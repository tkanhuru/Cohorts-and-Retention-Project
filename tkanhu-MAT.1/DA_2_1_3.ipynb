        "\n",
        "You got a follow up task from your product manager to give stats on how subscriptions churn looks like from a weekly retention standpoint. Your PM argues that to view retention numbers on a monthly basis takes too long and important insights from data might be missed out.\n",
        "\n",
        "You remember learning previously that cohorts analysis can be really helpful in such cases. You should provide weekly subscriptions data that would show how many subscribers who started on a particular week remain active in the upcoming 6 weeks. Your end result should show weekly retention cohorts and their retention from week 1 to week 6. Assume that you are doing this analysis on 2021-02-07.\n",
